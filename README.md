Different programming modules for the tasks as asked by someone



Generally, I try to help my friends when they need me. This is also true for the task like programming and problem solving.
Recently someone ask me to write a python module for a task. Now I just want to make available this to whomever needed. The help I am tring to provide may not be the best but it can support something. 



Task 1: im3dRot.py-- 3d rotation of an image plane.
